TOPIC: ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION OF DATA
INTRODUCTION:

 In this era where digital security is a great concern. With the advancement of technology and great use of internet and other related technologies, the need of encryption mechanism is greater to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. The Encryption and Decryption of Data project is designed to provide a foundational understanding of encryption techniques and their practical implementation in the context of C++ programming.

OBJECTIVES:

•	The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of encryption and decryption principles.
•	Learn how to implement encryption and decryption algorithms using the C++ programming language.
•	Learn the process of generating cryptographic keys and the importance of secure key management practices to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data.
•	Learn how encryption and decryption techniques implies in real world.
•	Learn about security practices.

SCOPE:

•	Secure transmission of data: 
               Encryption and decryption functionalities enable secure transmission of sensitive data over networks, safeguarding information from unauthorized access and interception.

•	Cryptographic key generation and management:
               Users can generate cryptographic keys securely and manage them effectively, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data.

•	Performance optimization:  
               The project is designed to handle encryption and decryption tasks efficiently, ensuring optimal performance. This allows for fast and reliable encryption and decryption processes without compromising security.

•	Easy implication:
User can easily encrypt and decrypt the data they write on console of the program and they can also encrypt and decrypt data stored in the file.

LIMITATIONS:
•	Scalability Issues: The Caesar cipher may not be suitable for encrypting large volumes of data or for use in high-performance computing environments due to its simplicity and lack of optimization for performance.
•	Vulnerable to brute force attack: The small number of possible keys means that an attacker can easily try all possible keys until the correct one is found, making it vulnerable to a brute force attack.
•	Scalability Issues: The Caesar cipher may not be suitable for encrypting large volumes of data or for use in high-performance computing environments due to its simplicity and lack of optimization for performance.

ASSUMPTIONS:
•	Case Sensitivity:
                       Our program can encrypt and decrypt both upper-case lower-case alphabets, it is case insensitive and treat both cases in same manner.
•	Fixed Key:
        Caser cipher works on fixed shift key of alphabets, which is the number of positions                by which each letter in the plaintext is shifted this key remains constant throughout the encryption and decryption process.
•	Alphabetic Text:
The Caesar cipher operates only on alphabetic characters, typically in the English alphabet. Other characters such as numbers, punctuation, and special symbols are usually ignored or left unchanged.
